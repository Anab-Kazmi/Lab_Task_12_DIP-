Prompt:

Perform a comprehensive segmentation analysis on a color image by:
Uploading a color image and converting it to grayscale.
Applying global thresholding with a fixed threshold value.
Applying Otsu’s thresholding for automatic global threshold selection.
Applying adaptive thresholding using Gaussian weighting.
Performing K-Means color segmentation for k = 2, 3, 4 clusters.
Applying Mean Shift filtering for image segmentation.
